# Fold

Time Series Cross-Validation at lightning speed.
→ fold allows to simulate and evaluate your models like they would have performed, in reality/when deployed, with clever use of paralellization and design.

Create composite models: ensembles, hybrids, stacking pipelines, easily.
→ Underutilized, but the easiest, fastest way to increase performance of your Time Series models.

Built with Distributed Computing in mind.
→ Deploy your research and development pipelines to a cluster with ray, and use modin to handle out-of-memory datasets (full support for modin is coming in April).

Bridging the gap between Online and Mini-Batch learning.
→ Mix and match xgboost with ARIMA, in a single pipeline, update your models, preprocessing steps on every timestamp, if that's desired.

Update your deployed models, easily, as new data flows in.
→ Real world is not static. Let your models adapt, without the need to re-train from scratch.
