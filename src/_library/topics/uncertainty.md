# Point forecasts are not enough

In the real world, point forecasts only reveal the mean or median of the projected future.
We're enriching the forecasts with an the entire probability distribution, resulting in lots of actionable business-critical insights, that you can count on.

### More detail:

When it comes to time-series forecasting, point forecasts can be useful in providing an estimate of what the future might hold. However, relying solely on point forecasts can be limiting, as they only provide a single value that represents the most likely outcome. In reality, the future is uncertain, and it's essential to understand the range of possibilities and associated probabilities to make informed decisions.

That's where probabilistic forecasting comes in. Probabilistic forecasting goes beyond point forecasts and provides a full probability distribution that encompasses all potential outcomes, along with their associated probabilities. By doing so, it offers a more nuanced and comprehensive view of the future.

Probabilistic forecasts can be generated using various statistical methods, including Bayesian inference, bootstrapping, and Monte Carlo simulation. These methods enable the generation of multiple scenarios that capture the inherent uncertainty in the data, such as seasonality, trend, and random fluctuations.

One significant advantage of probabilistic forecasting is that it can provide decision-makers with a range of insights, such as the likelihood of specific outcomes, potential risks and opportunities, and optimal risk management strategies. These insights can help businesses to make more informed decisions, anticipate potential challenges, and respond quickly to changes in the market.

Moreover, probabilistic forecasting is becoming more accessible to data scientists and forecasting practitioners. With the emergence of machine learning and deep learning techniques, it's possible to create highly accurate and reliable probabilistic forecasts, even for complex and large-scale data sets.
