# Point forecasts are not enough

In the real world, point forecasts only reveal the mean or median of the projected future.
We're enriching the forecasts with an the entire probability distribution, resulting in lots of actionable business-critical insights, that you can count on.

### More detail:

When it comes to time-series forecasting, point forecasts can be useful in providing an estimate of what the future might hold. However, relying solely on point forecasts can be limiting, as they only provide a single value that represents the most likely outcome. In reality, the future is uncertain, and it's essential to understand the range of possibilities and associated probabilities to make informed decisions.

That's where probabilistic forecasting comes in. Probabilistic forecasting goes beyond point forecasts and provides a full probability distribution that encompasses all potential outcomes, along with their associated probabilities. By doing so, it offers a more nuanced and comprehensive view of the future.

Probabilistic forecasts can be generated using various statistical methods, including Bayesian inference, bootstrapping, Monte Carlo simulation and Conformal Predictions. The effectiveness of the latter method has stood out for us and we're committed adapters of this new, more more accurate method.
