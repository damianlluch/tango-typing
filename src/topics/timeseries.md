# Time Series Forecasting

Forecasting the future is the essential business problem - it's also the hardest one!
Applying Machine Learning naively will create suprises along the way.

We specialize in modeling non-stationary time series, where the underlying process that generates the data changes over time.
Like in all Complex Dynamical Systems.

Applying machine learning to non-stationary time series forecasting requires careful consideration and domain expertise. Naive application of machine learning algorithms can often result in unexpected outcomes or false conclusions. This is because machine learning models are typically overfitted on a given dataset, but may not perform well when deployed in the real world, where the underlying processes may be changing over time.
